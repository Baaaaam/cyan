# CyAn - Cyclus Analysis Tools

CyAn contains command line tools for post processing and analyzing Cyclus
simulation databases (http://fuelcycle.org). It is still experimental and not
all features have been validated/verified to be correct.

## Installation

Binary builds of CyAn are provided for Windows, Linux, and Mac platforms (both
32 and 64 bit) here: https://github.com/rwcarlsen/cyan/releases.  These
binaries have no external dependencies and can just be executed directly.

To build and install from source, you need the Go toolchain.  You can get it from
http://golang.org/doc/install or you can use your favorite package manager:

```bash
# debian-based distros
apt-get install golang

# archlinux
pacman -S go

# mac OSX with macports
port install go
```

You should make a directory to use as your GOPATH and set the GOPATH
environment variable to it.  The Go tool will install packages into this
directory.  For convenience, you should also add `$GOPATH/bin` to your PATH so
that binaries from fetched packages are directly accessible on the command
line.  When you are ready, run:

```bash
go get github.com/rwcarlsen/cyan/cmd/cyan
```

## Usage

There primary command line tool is `cyan`.  The commands has various flags and
subcommands that can be viewed with the `-h` flag:

```
Usage: cyan [-db <cyclus-db>] [flags...] <command> [flags...] [args...]
Computes metrics for cyclus simulation data in a sqlite database.

Options:
  -cpuprofile string
    	write cpu profile to file
  -custom string
    	path to custom sql query spec file
  -db string
    	cyclus sqlite database to query
  -query
    	show query SQL for a subcommand instead of executing it
  -simid string
    	simulation id in hex (empty string defaults to first sim id in database

Sub-commands:
    post: Just post process the database
    infile: Show the simulation's input file
    sims: List all simulations in the database
    agents: List all agents in the simulation
    protos: List all prototypes in the simulation
    commods: Show commodities with respective transaction counts and quantities
    trans: Time series of transactions over time (by quantity)
    power: Time series of power produced
    deployed: Time series of a prototype's total active deployments
    built: Time series of a new builds of a prototype
    inv: Time series of agents' inventory
    flow: Time series of material transacted between agents
    flowgraph: Generate a graphviz dotfile graph of resource flows between agents
    energy: Thermal energy (J) generated by the simulation between 2 timesteps
    created: Material created by one or more agents between specific timesteps
    table: Show the contents of a specific table
    ts: Investigate any/all time series data
```

Subcommands each take their own arguments and have their own help/ussage
messages.  Global arguments must be given *before* the subcommand name (e.g.
``-db``, ``-query``, etc.).  And subcommand arguments must be provided
*before* any positional arguments.  Some quick examples:

```bash
# show help/usage for the "deployed" subcommand
cyan deployed -h
# Output:
# Usage: deployed <prototype>
# Time series of a prototype's total active deployments
#   -p	plot the dat

# show a list of all agents/facilities that ever existed in the simulation
cyan -db cyclus.sqlite agents

# output a time series of active deployments for all AP1000 facilities
cyan -db cyclus.sqlite deployed AP1000

# plot a active deployments for all AP1000 facilities using gnuplot
cyan -db cyclus.sqlite deployed -p AP1000

# print the SQL query cyan uses to generate "deployed" subcommand results
cyan -db cyclus.sqlite -query deployed AP1000

# list all tables in the database
cyan -db cyclus.sqlite table

# print the content of a particular table
cyan -db cyclus.sqlite table myCustomTableName

# just post process the db (this is done automatically by other commands too)
cyan -db cyclus.sqlite post

# output a png graph of the flow of all material between agents t=2 to t=7
cyan -db cyclus.sqlite flowgraph -t1=2 -t2=7 > flow.dot
dot -Tpng -o flow.png flow.dot
```

## Cross Compilation

To cross-compile for all major architectures/OS's supported by Go, you can use
`xgo` (https://github.com/karalabe/xgo) - for example:

```
xgo -targets linux/amd64,windows/386,windows/amd64 github.com/rwcarlsen/cyan/cmd/cyan
```

And you will get 64 bit linux, 32 bit windows and 64 bit windows binaries.
